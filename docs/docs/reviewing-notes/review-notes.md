### How To Review Notes

To review notes, your user must have the required permissions. If you do not have the permissions
to review notes you can review the documentation to grant access to the feature on the previous
page.

### To review notes
The most convenient place to review notes is from the notes tab located in the side navigation. The notes
screen lists all notes in your office by Date Of Service in descending order.
Below are the steps you can follow to sign off or review other providers' notes.

1. Ensure you are logged in as a user with the proper permissions.
2. Click the "view" link from the right side of the screen or from any place you can view a note.
3. Click the "mark note as reviewed" button on the note view modal.

Once you have performed the 3 steps above you should see that the note was reviewed by you. You will
also see a green check mark in the reviewed column. Once a note is reviewed, the reviewers name will
display under the providers name when the note is printed.
