# Allow users to review notes for other providers

The ability to review notes is common in offices where a supervisor is required to sign off on notes and 
display their electronic signature along with the provider that performed the service on printed notes.

Before a staff member will be allowed to review notes of other providers in QuickerNotes, you will 
have to grant them the proper privileges to do so.

### Instructions to grant a user permission to review notes.
1. Navigate to the dashboard when logged into QuickerNotes as a user with "owner" privileges.
2. Click the tab labeled **Manage Users**
	- If you don't see and admin section on your dashboard you are not logged in with a user who has "owner" privileges.
3. Find the user you want to grant "reviewer" privileges to and click the edit button under the manage heading.
4. You should now see a screen like the one below, check the box labeled 
	_This user can review and sign off on the notes of other providers_ and then click the Update User button
