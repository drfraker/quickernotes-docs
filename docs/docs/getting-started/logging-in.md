# Logging In
To log into QuickerNotes software go to [https://quickernotes.com/login][qn-login]

## Your first time logging in
The first time you log into QuickerNotes you should do so with your MINDBODY **Owner** account. If you don't have access
to this account you will need to contact MINDBODY for the account information or to reset the owner password.
QuickerNotes does note have access to your MINDBODY passwords and we have no way to reset them.

## Adding your staff members
QuickerNotes will automatically add all of the staff members from your MINDBODY site. We will set each user's role
to the minimum settings by default.

**Default user settings**
- They are assigned a role of "user"
- They are allowed to login but are only allowed to see their own appointments and notes.
- They cannot "review" notes.

### Edit your staff profile to increase permissions
Assuming you are logged in with the owner account you will see a Clinic Admin section at the top of your dashboard.
![Owner Dashboard](/images/owner-dashboard.png "owner dashboard")

- Find your **Staff Profile** ( the MINDBODY staff member that you schedule appointments with ) from the "manage users"
tab. 
- Click the edit button from that user's row in the table
- Set the role to "owner"
- Uncheck the checkbox to allow the user to see all appointments and notes.

*In some instances the MINDBODY owner account is the same as the staff member profile that you book appointments with.
In those instances you will always log in with that profile.*

## Subsequent Logins
On all subsequent logins you will be able to login with your staff profile instead of the MINDBODY owner profile.
You won't want to login as the owner unless you schedule appointments for that profile in the MINDBODY software.
