# Uploading Background Images
In order to use the body diagram feature you must first upload at least one background image to draw on. You can 
upload any image you would like and usually a google image search will contain many results that you may be 
looking for.

## To upload an image
- Navigate to the [Templates][Templates] page of the application.

- Click "Upload" button to upload the file.
- You should now see a thumbnail image of the file you just uploaded in the list of backgrounds
	for your office.
