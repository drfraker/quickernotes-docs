# Quickernotes

QuickerNotes is a SOAP notes application that integrates with the MINDBODY platform. We use data from your 
MINDBODY site to create a robust charting system without the need for duplicated data entry. This documentation
is meant to take you from sign up to advanced usage in as little time as possible. 

If you have any questions that we don't answer here, please 
<a href="mailto:support@quickernotes.com?subject=Question from the documentation">email support</a>.

# This Documentation
This documentation is a work in progress. As we receive questions or a user has a problem we will add it here. Also 
we will be adding documentation of all features of QuickerNotes over time. We decided it was better to get ***some***
documentation up early, rather that wait until ***all*** documentation was done to publish the site.
