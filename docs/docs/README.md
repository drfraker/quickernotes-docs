# About Quickernotes

QuickerNotes is a SOAP notes application that integrates with the MINDBODY platform. We use data from your 
MINDBODY site to create a robust charting system without the need for duplicated data entry. This documentation
is meant to take you from sign up to advanced usage in as little time as possible. 

If you have any questions that we don't answer here, please give us a shout.
